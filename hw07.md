1.
(1). LOD # 1–>STO X –> LOD X –> ADD#3 –> STO Y –> HLT

(2)main memory——>fetch instruction——>decode instruction——>register——>get data——>execute the instruction

(3)IR：指令寄存器，用来保存当前正在执行的一条指令 

  PC：程序计数器，存放下一条指令在内存中的地址 

ACC：累加寄存器，功能是当运算器的算术逻辑单元(ALU)执行全部算术和逻辑运算时，为ALU提供一个工作区，暂时存放ALU运算结果

2.简答题

(1)指令和数据

(2)可以

(3)例 ADD X：00010000 10000000
第四位为寻址模式，1即代表后八位为数值。即加128至存储的数字。

3.名词解释

### 汇编语言(assembly language)
An assembly (or assembler) language,often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.
### 编译(Compiler)
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.
### 命令式语言(Imperative programming)
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.
### 函数编程语言(functional programming)
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
### 过程式编程(Procedural programming)
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
